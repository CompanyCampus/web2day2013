Look around you. You'll see two councilmen, a union official, couple off-duty
cops and a judge. I wouldn't have a second's hesitation of blowing your head
off in front of them. Now, that's power you can't buy. That's the power of

Seven hundred twelve counts of extortion. Eight hundred and forty-nine counts
of racketeering. Two hundred and forty-six counts of fraud. Eighty-seven
counts of conspiracy murder.Five hundred and twenty-seven counts of
obstruction of justice. How do the defendants plead?
