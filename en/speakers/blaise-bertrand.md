Associate Partner and Industrial Design Director Blaise Bertrand leads IDEO’s Palo Alto office, where he oversees multidisciplinary designers, works with European clients, and ensures high-quality, world-class innovation work for diverse clients, including Hyundai Kia, Medtronic, Nike, Renault, and Samsung.
Blaise’s passions include the future of transportation, the evolution of the car industry, and the leading edge of design. To advance global discussion in the creative community, Blaise established Designs On—, an innovation platform that presents forward-thinking provocations around themes such as Food, Global Warming, and Packaging.
An award-winning designer, Blaise holds several patents. His concept for a time capsule was selected as a finalist in a The New York Times competition, and two lamps he conceived were exhibited at the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum in New York. He coled a project featured in Gary Hustwit’s documentary Objectified, and his work has also been featured in numerous international magazines. In 2011, Blaise judged the IDEA Awards and spoke at La Tortue Bleue conference.
Prior to joining IDEO, Blaise worked for Motorola in its San Francisco and Milan (Italy) design studios and for Adobe Systems in Silicon Valley. He earned a master’s degree in industrial design from ENSCI-Les Ateliers in Paris.
