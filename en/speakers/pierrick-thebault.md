After 5 years studying at L’Ecole de Design Nantes Atlantique, 1 year of freelancing and 3 years at Bell Labs, Pierrick has explored a variety of design fields (user interface design, interaction design, user experience design and design research) and has learned to work within different contexts, both directly with clients and within a multidiciplinary team. He has learned to master the tools and methods that allow exploring user’s needs, creating design artifacts, prototyping them as well as evaluating their usability and user experience.
