Nicolas Kayser-Bril is a nerd. He also is the co-founder and CEO of the company Journalism++. Before that, he was head of datajournalism at Owni.
For a living, he tells stories using data. He crunches, grinds, chews and squeezes numbers to extract meaning out of them. That's called data-driven journalism and he has been one of the first ones to practice it in Europe.
