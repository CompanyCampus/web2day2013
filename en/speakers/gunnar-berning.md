Gunnar Berning has more than 15 years of experience working in different exciting areas from creative industries to well-known major global brands. Gunnar, being a 39-year-old  father of two kids, is quite different from the typical Berlin start-up entrepreneur.
Before he became his own boss with founding twago, the passionate marathon runner worked very successfully as a sports photographer with Getty Images (former Bongarts Sportfotografie) attending the Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996 as well as in Sydney in 2000. He also covered the last major title of the German national football team in England wining the EURO 1996. Working as a sports photographer allowed Gunnar to finance his studies of Economies and Engineering at the Technical University of Karlsruhe back then.
Being always the visionary that he used to be already as a sport photographer, Gunnar decided against a top management career with Siemens and finally founded twago together with Maria Lindinger and Thomas Jajeh in 2009.
