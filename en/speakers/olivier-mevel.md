Olivier co-founded in 1995, with Philippe Feinsilber, one of the first digital agency and in 2000 was part of the Kasskooye collective that made fun of the crazy new economy.

In 2003, he co-founded with rafi Haladjian, Violet, the company behind Nabaztag, the widely popular Wifi bunny now seen as the Internet of Things icon.

When Violet was bought-out in 2009 by Mindscape Olivier co-founded with Marc Chareyron (Olivier doesn't know to do anything alone :-)) 23 de Enero and they created reaDIYmate and TeleSound. Both products were launched on Kickstarter.
