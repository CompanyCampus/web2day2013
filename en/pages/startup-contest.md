Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria
and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also
clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We
swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However
unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just
on opposite ends.
